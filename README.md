*DESCRIPTION*

The Day 1 task assigned during the internship program focused on building a basic yet practical File Handling Utility in Java. The main objective of this task was to understand how file input and output operations work in Java and to implement a working program that can perform three essential operations on a text file: reading, writing, and modifying (appending) data. File handling is a fundamental concept in software development because almost every real-world application interacts with files in some form, such as storing user information, saving application logs, managing configuration settings, or generating reports. Through this task, I was able to gain hands-on experience with these core concepts and understand their real-life applications.
For the development and implementation of this task, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my primary editing platform and development environment. VS Code is a lightweight yet powerful code editor that supports Java development through extensions such as the “Extension Pack for Java.” It provides essential features like syntax highlighting, code suggestions, integrated terminal, and quick run/debug options. These features helped me write clean and structured Java code, identify and fix syntax errors quickly, and compile and run the program directly from the editor. VS Code also made it easier to manage project files such as the Java source file, the generated output file, screenshots of the program execution, and documentation files in a single workspace. Using a professional IDE/editor improved my workflow and helped me follow proper coding practices from the beginning of the internship.
The solution developed for this task is a menu-driven Java console application named FileHandlingUtility.java. The menu-driven approach was chosen to make the program user-friendly and interactive. When the program is executed, it displays a menu with multiple options: write data to a file, read data from the file, modify the file by appending new content, and exit the application. This design allows the user to perform different file operations in a single execution of the program and clearly demonstrates the functionality of each operation. The user interacts with the program by entering their choice through the console, which makes the utility easy to test and use even for beginners.
To implement file handling operations, standard Java I/O classes such as FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter were used. Buffered streams were selected over basic file streams because they improve performance and efficiency by reducing the number of direct read and write operations to the file system. When the user selects the option to write data, the program creates a text file named sample.txt in the project directory if it does not already exist and writes the user-provided content into it. This demonstrates how Java can be used to create new files and store data persistently. When the user selects the read option, the program reads the content of the file line by line and displays it on the console, showing how data can be retrieved from a file and presented to the user. The modify option allows the user to append additional content to the existing file without deleting the previous data. This operation is particularly useful in real-world scenarios such as maintaining log files, updating records, or adding new entries to an existing dataset.
An important part of this task was not only implementing the code but also preparing clear documentation and execution proof as part of the deliverable. The documentation explains the objective of the task, the problem statement, the approach used to design the solution, the tools and technologies used, and the steps required to run the program. Additionally, screenshots of the program output and the generated sample.txt file were included to demonstrate that the program works correctly and performs the required file operations. This practice reflects professional software development standards, where code is always accompanied by proper documentation and evidence of execution so that others can easily understand, review, and verify the work.
During the implementation of this task, I also learned the importance of organizing project files and maintaining a clean project structure. The Java source file, output file, screenshots folder, and documentation were organized in a single project directory and uploaded to GitHub for version control and sharing. Using GitHub helped me understand how to manage project repositories, commit files, and share the project link with mentors or team members. This step is crucial in professional environments, where version control systems are used to collaborate with teams and maintain a history of changes in the codebase.
Overall, the Day 1 task provided a strong foundation in Java file handling and practical exposure to working with an IDE like VS Code. It improved my understanding of how files are created, read, and updated programmatically and how user input can be handled in a console-based application. The task also helped me develop good habits such as writing clear documentation, organizing project files properly, and presenting my work in a professional manner on GitHub. In the future, this utility can be further enhanced by adding features such as deleting files, adding timestamps to file entries, supporting multiple files, validating user input more strictly, and implementing more detailed exception handling. These enhancements would make the application more robust and closer to real-world software systems.
